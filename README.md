# Aziz's Dotfiles

Hi, welcome to my treasure of the dotfiles. Linux is so great and I'm thankful
that it provide so much customization. I use with [GNU Stow][stow-link] to link
them on my local files.

They sync so nicely and I immediately get the changes. I use an awesome
terminal application called [WezTerm][wezterm-link]. It's an incredible
terminal with so much customization.

For easy setup run:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

I hope you create your own good looking terminal. Which you might want to use
everyday. I certainly enjoy mine.
