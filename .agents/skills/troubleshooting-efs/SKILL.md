# Troubleshooting EFS

## Overview

Domain expertise for diagnosing and resolving Amazon EFS issues. Covers mount
failures, NFS connectivity, IAM and POSIX permissions, throughput and performance,
and encryption problems.

For authoritative guidance, see [EFS Troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/troubleshooting.html).

## Common Tasks

### 0. Verify Dependencies

- You MUST verify `aws` CLI is available
- You MUST check if `amazon-efs-utils` or `nfs-utils` is installed on the instance
- You MUST ONLY check for tool existence and version — MUST NOT execute destructive or mutating commands during verification
- You MUST inform the user if any required tools are missing
- You MUST respect the user's decision to abort if tools are unavailable
- You SHOULD explain what each step does and why before executing it
- You SHOULD display write commands and wait for user confirmation before executing

### 1. Classify the Issue

| Symptom | Category |
|---|---|
| "wrong fs type" or mount command fails | A: Missing NFS Client |
| Connection timed out (hangs 2+ min) | B: Network/Security Group |
| "access denied by server" | C: IAM/Permissions |
| Slow throughput or high latency | D: Performance |
| NFS server error on encrypted FS | E: Encryption/KMS |
| DNS name resolution fails | F: VPC DNS |

### 2. Category A — Missing NFS Client

```bash
# Amazon Linux / RHEL / CentOS
sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils  # preferred (includes mount helper + TLS)
# OR
sudo yum -y install nfs-utils

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
```

### 3. Category B — Network/Security Group

Connection timeout is the #1 EFS mount failure — almost always security groups.

1. Verify mount target exists in the instance's AZ:

```bash
aws efs describe-mount-targets --file-system-id fs-ID --region REGION
```

1. Verify security groups — check BOTH directions:
   - Mount target SG: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-MT` — MUST have inbound TCP 2049 from compute SG
   - Compute SG: MUST have outbound TCP 2049 to mount target SG
   - Quick fix: `aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-MT --protocol tcp --port 2049 --source-group sg-COMPUTE`

2. Test connectivity:

```bash
nc -zv fs-ID.efs.REGION.amazonaws.com 2049
```

> **Note:** These security group troubleshooting steps also apply to S3 Files. The only difference is S3 Files uses `aws s3files list-mount-targets` instead of `aws efs describe-mount-targets`.

### 4. Category C — IAM/Permissions

**"access denied by server" with `-o iam`:**

- Check identity-based IAM policy has `elasticfilesystem:ClientMount`
- Check file system resource policy:

```bash
aws efs describe-file-system-policy --file-system-id fs-ID --region REGION
```

**Note:** IAM authorization is only enforced when a file system policy exists that requires it. Without a file system policy, any client in the VPC with port 2049 access can mount — even with `-o iam`. To enforce IAM, you MUST create a file system policy that denies anonymous access.

**POSIX permission denied (not IAM):**

- Check file/directory ownership: `ls -la /mnt/efs/`
- Use access points to enforce UID/GID for consistent permissions

### 5. Category D — Performance

**Check throughput mode:**

```bash
aws efs describe-file-systems --file-system-id fs-ID --region REGION --query 'FileSystems[0].ThroughputMode'
```

**Burst credit exhaustion (Bursting mode only):**

```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/EFS --metric-name BurstCreditBalance --dimensions Name=FileSystemId,Value=fs-ID --period 3600 --statistics Average --start-time $(date -u -d '24 hours ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) --end-time $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)
```

If credits near zero, switch to Elastic throughput:

```bash
aws efs update-file-system --file-system-id fs-ID --throughput-mode elastic --region REGION
```

**General Purpose vs Max I/O:**

- Check `PercentIOLimit` metric — if consistently >80%, consider Max I/O
- Note: performance mode is IMMUTABLE — must create new FS and migrate

### 6. Category E — Encryption/KMS

NFS server error on encrypted FS = KMS key issue.

- Verify key is enabled in KMS console
- Verify EFS service-linked role has KMS permissions
- If key deleted: cancel deletion if within grace period

### 7. Category F — VPC DNS

DNS resolution failure = VPC DNS settings disabled.

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-ID --attribute enableDnsHostnames
aws ec2 describe-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-ID --attribute enableDnsSupport
```

Both MUST be `true`. If not:

```bash
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-ID --enable-dns-hostnames Value=true
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-ID --enable-dns-support Value=true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mount hangs then times out
Most common cause: security group. Verify TCP 2049 is open between compute and mount target.

### Auto-mount fails on reboot
`/etc/fstab` entry MUST include `_netdev` option to wait for network before mounting.

### "nfs not responding" after reconnect
Old kernel bug with TCP port reuse. Update kernel or add `noresvport` mount option.

### Enable Debug Logs

Set `logging_level = DEBUG` in `/etc/amazon/efs/efs-utils.conf`. Logs at `/var/log/amazon/efs/mount.log`.

### Collect Logs for AWS Support

```bash
sudo tar -czf /tmp/efs-logs.tar.gz /var/log/amazon/efs/ /etc/amazon/efs/efs-utils.conf
```

## Security Considerations

- IAM authorization is only enforced when a file system policy exists — without one, any VPC client with port 2049 access can mount
- When troubleshooting access denied, verify both identity-based and resource-based policies
- Use `-o tls` for encryption in transit — unencrypted NFS traffic is visible on the network
- Restrict `/var/log/amazon/efs/` access — logs may contain file system IDs and mount target IPs
