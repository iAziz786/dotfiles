# Troubleshooting S3 Files

## Overview

Diagnoses and resolves Amazon S3 Files issues: mount failures, IAM
permissions, synchronization, conflict resolution, and performance.

For authoritative guidance, see [S3 Files Troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-files-troubleshooting.html).

## Common Tasks

### 0. Verify Dependencies

- You MUST verify `aws` CLI is available with `s3files` subcommand support
- You MUST confirm valid AWS credentials
- You MUST ONLY check for tool existence and version — MUST NOT execute destructive or mutating commands during verification
- You MUST inform the user if any required tools are missing
- You MUST respect the user's decision to abort if tools are unavailable
- You SHOULD explain steps before executing and wait for user confirmation on write commands

### 1. Classify the Issue

| Symptom | Category |
|---|---|
| mount.s3files: command not found | A: Client Installation |
| Connection timed out during mount | B: Network/Security Group |
| Mount hangs indefinitely (no timeout) | B: Network/Security Group |
| Access denied during mount | C: IAM Permissions |
| File system stuck in "creating" | C: IAM Permissions |
| Permission denied on file operations | C: IAM Permissions |
| Files not appearing in S3 after write | D: Synchronization |
| Files in .s3files-lost+found directory | E: Conflict Resolution |
| Slow reads or high latency | F: Performance |
| NFS server error | G: Encryption/KMS |
| DNS name resolution fails | H: VPC DNS |

### 2. Category A — Client Installation

`mount.s3files: command not found` means `amazon-efs-utils` is missing or < v3.0.0.

```bash
sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils  # Amazon Linux
```

### 3. Category B — Network/Security Group

Connection timeout is the #1 mount failure — almost always security groups.

Verify mount target exists in the instance's AZ:

```bash
aws s3files list-mount-targets --file-system-id fs-ID --region REGION
```

Cross-AZ mounting works but adds latency.

Verify security groups — most common fix:

- Mount target SG MUST have inbound TCP 2049 from compute SG
- Compute SG MUST have outbound TCP 2049 to mount target SG
- Fix: `aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-MT --protocol tcp --port 2049 --source-group sg-COMPUTE`

Test connectivity:

```bash
nc -zv az-ID.fs-ID.s3files.REGION.on.aws 2049
```

> **Note:** These SG troubleshooting steps also apply to EFS — use `aws efs describe-mount-targets` instead.

**Mount hangs in isolated VPC**: If the VPC has no internet access, S3 Files requires a CloudWatch Logs VPC endpoint (`com.amazonaws.REGION.logs`) for mount to complete.

### 4. Category C — IAM Permissions

**File system stuck in "creating" status:**
S3 Files does NOT validate IAM role permissions at creation time. Wrong trust policy or missing permissions → stuck in `creating` with access denied in `statusMessage`.

Check status:

```bash
aws s3files get-file-system --file-system-id fs-ID --region REGION
```

Check `statusMessage`. If access denied, fix the IAM role and delete/recreate.

**Mount access denied:** Compute role needs `s3files:ClientMount`. For dev/test only, `AmazonS3FilesClientFullAccess` is acceptable — avoid in production.

**Write permission denied:** Compute role needs `s3files:ClientWrite`

**Root access denied:** Compute role needs `s3files:ClientRootAccess`. ⚠️ Bypasses POSIX permissions — prefer access points with scoped POSIX users.

**Check file system policy:**

```bash
aws s3files get-file-system-policy --file-system-id fs-ID --region REGION
```

### 5. Category D — Synchronization

**Files not appearing in S3:** Writes sync within ~60 seconds. Check status:

```bash
getfattr -n "user.s3files.status;$(date -u +%s)" filename --only-values
```

Common ExportError values:

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| S3AccessDenied | File system IAM role lacks S3 write permissions |
| S3BucketNotFound | Bucket deleted or renamed |
| RoleAssumptionFailed | Trust policy misconfigured |
| EncryptionKeyInaccessible | KMS key disabled or permissions revoked |
| PathTooLong | File path exceeds 1,024 byte S3 key limit |

Monitor: `PendingExports` CloudWatch metric. Growing = exceeds 800 files/sec rate.

### 6. Category E — Conflict Resolution

Files in `.s3files-lost+found-{fs-id}` = sync conflict (modified via FS and S3 simultaneously). S3 wins; FS version moved to lost+found.

### 7. Category F — Performance

**First access latency:** Normal — first directory access imports metadata.

**Intelligent read routing not working:** Compute role needs `s3:GetObject` on the bucket.

**Slow writes:** If `PendingExports` growing, distribute across multiple file systems.

### 8. Category G — Encryption/KMS

NFS server error with encrypted FS = KMS issue. Verify key is enabled and role has KMS permissions.

### 9. Category H — VPC DNS

DNS resolution failure = VPC DNS settings disabled.

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-ID --attribute enableDnsHostnames
aws ec2 describe-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-ID --attribute enableDnsSupport
```

Both MUST be `true`. If not:

```bash
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-ID --enable-dns-hostnames Value=true
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --vpc-id vpc-ID --enable-dns-support Value=true
```

## Troubleshooting

### AWS CLI endpoint URL cannot be resolved
CLI is too old for S3 Files. Run `aws --version` — if v1.x, upgrade to AWS CLI v2: [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

### ECS task fails with DNS resolution error
Used `efsVolumeConfiguration` instead of `s3filesVolumeConfiguration`. Fix: use `fileSystemArn` in S3 Files-specific volume config.

### S3 Files vs other products confusion
S3 Files is NOT Mountpoint for S3, S3 File Gateway, or File Cache. Uses `aws s3files` CLI, `s3files:` IAM actions, `mount -t s3files`.

### Enable Debug Logs

Set `logging_level = DEBUG` in `/etc/amazon/efs/s3files-utils.conf`. Logs at `/var/log/amazon/efs/mount.log`.

### Collect Logs for AWS Support

```bash
sudo tar -czf /tmp/s3files-logs.tar.gz /var/log/amazon/efs/ /etc/amazon/efs/s3files-utils.conf
```

## Security Considerations

- When diagnosing IAM issues, verify least-privilege — avoid FullAccess as a shortcut
- Without a file system policy, any VPC client can mount
- Restrict `/var/log/amazon/efs/` access — logs contain S3 key names
