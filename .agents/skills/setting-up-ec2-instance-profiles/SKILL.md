# Setting Up EC2 Instance Profiles

## Overview

Domain expertise for granting EC2 instances secure access to AWS services using IAM roles
and instance profiles. Covers the full lifecycle: identifying required permissions, creating
or reusing IAM roles with least-privilege policies, creating instance profiles, attaching
them to EC2 instances, and verifying credential availability.

## Configure an EC2 instance profile

To set up an IAM role and instance profile for an EC2 instance, follow the procedure exactly.
See [EC2 instance profile setup procedure](references/ec2-instance-profile-setup.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Instance not found

Verify the instance ID and region are correct. List instances with `aws ec2 describe-instances --region <region>`.

### Instance already has a profile

The procedure handles replacement — it will prompt before disassociating the existing profile.

### Credentials not available after attachment

Instance profile propagation can take 30–60 seconds. Applications may need a restart to pick up new credentials.

### Access denied errors

Check that the role's policies include the required actions and resource ARNs. Review CloudTrail logs for the specific denied action.

### Application still uses hardcoded credentials

Remove credentials from config files, environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), and `~/.aws/credentials`. The SDK default credential chain will then use the instance profile.
