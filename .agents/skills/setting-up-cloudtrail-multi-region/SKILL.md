# Setting Up CloudTrail Multi-Region

## Overview

Domain expertise for enabling AWS CloudTrail across all regions to capture
comprehensive API activity logs and configuring CloudWatch Logs Insights for
security monitoring, compliance auditing, and operational analysis.

## Set up a multi-region trail

To create a centralized multi-region CloudTrail trail with S3 storage, CloudWatch
Logs integration, and log analysis, follow the procedure exactly.
See [CloudTrail multi-region setup procedure](references/cloudtrail-multi-region-setup.md).

## Troubleshooting

### S3 bucket already exists

Choose a different globally unique name, or add a timestamp or organization identifier.

### Permission denied errors

Verify your identity with `aws sts get-caller-identity`. Ensure your user/role has required actions attached. Do NOT use `*FullAccess` managed policies.

### Trail not logging

Verify IAM role permissions, check S3 bucket policy allows CloudTrail access, and ensure the trail is started with `start-logging`.

### Missing events in CloudWatch

Allow 5-15 minutes for initial log delivery. Verify the CloudWatch Logs role ARN is correct and the log group exists in the same region as the trail.

### Opt-in region events not appearing

This is normal — events from opt-in regions may take several hours. Wait up to 24 hours before investigating further.
