# Exporting RDS/Aurora to S3

## Overview

Domain expertise for exporting Amazon RDS and Aurora database snapshots to Amazon S3
in Apache Parquet format. Covers the full workflow: snapshot identification or creation,
IAM role and KMS encryption setup, S3 bucket preparation, export task initiation,
progress monitoring, data verification, and post-export access guidance for analytics
services like Athena, Glue, and Redshift Spectrum.

## Export an RDS or Aurora snapshot to S3

To export a database snapshot to S3 with proper IAM roles, encryption, and monitoring,
follow the procedure exactly.
See [RDS to S3 export procedure](references/export-rds-to-s3.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Database not found
Verify the database identifier spelling, case, and region. For Aurora, use `describe-db-clusters` instead of `describe-db-instances`.

### Export not supported
Snapshot export supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora MySQL, and Aurora PostgreSQL only. Oracle and SQL Server are not supported.

### IAM role permission errors
Ensure the role trust policy allows `export.rds.amazonaws.com` with `aws:SourceAccount` and `aws:SourceArn` conditions for confused deputy protection, and has S3 PutObject and KMS permissions. Wait 10–15 seconds after role creation for propagation.

### Export stuck or failed
Check the export task status for failure reasons. Common causes: S3 bucket deleted, IAM role modified, or KMS key disabled during export. See the [full procedure](references/export-rds-to-s3.md) for detailed troubleshooting.
