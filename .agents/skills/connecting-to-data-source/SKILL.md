# Connect to Data Source

Register an external data source with AWS Glue so downstream skills (ingesting-into-data-lake) can move data from it. A Glue connection stores the network config, driver, and credential reference for one source. Create once per source, reuse across jobs.

## Philosophy

**A connection is a named pipe, not a pipeline.** This skill produces a tested, reusable Glue connection. It does not move data.

## Common Tasks

You MUST execute commands using AWS MCP server tools when connected -- they provide validation, sandboxed execution, and audit logging. Fall back to AWS CLI only if MCP is unavailable. You MUST explain each step before executing.

## Workflow

### 1. Verify Dependencies and Context

- You MUST check whether AWS MCP tools or AWS CLI are available and inform the user if missing
- You MUST confirm target AWS region and verify credentials with `aws sts get-caller-identity`

### 2. Classify the Source

Ask the user which source type they want to connect to, or infer from hints:

| User says... | Source type | Connection type | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Oracle", "SQL Server", "Postgres", "MySQL", "RDS \<engine\>" | JDBC database | `JDBC` | [jdbc-setup.md](references/jdbc-setup.md) |
| "Redshift", "my cluster", "my data warehouse on AWS" | Redshift | `JDBC` | [jdbc-setup.md](references/jdbc-setup.md) (Redshift section) |
| "Snowflake" | Snowflake | `SNOWFLAKE` | [snowflake-setup.md](references/snowflake-setup.md) |
| "BigQuery", "Google analytics warehouse" | BigQuery | `BIGQUERY` | [bigquery-setup.md](references/bigquery-setup.md) |

If the user names DynamoDB or a local file, stop and tell them: DynamoDB is read directly by Glue without a connection, and local files belong in the ingesting-into-data-lake skill's local-upload workflow.

### 3. Gather Connection Hints from the User

You MUST ask for hints the user can provide -- do not guess.

**For all sources:**

- Desired connection name (lowercase, hyphens: `oracle-prod-sales`, `snowflake-analytics`)
- Existing Secrets Manager secret, or create one
- Is source reachable from a Glue VPC (same, peered, VPN, Direct Connect)

**JDBC:** hostname/endpoint, port, database, whether RDS/Aurora/self-managed, IAM DB auth enabled (Aurora/RDS MySQL/Postgres), SSL required.

**Snowflake:** account identifier, warehouse, role, default database, auth (password, key-pair, OAuth).

**BigQuery:** GCP project ID, location, whether service account JSON is provisioned.

### 4. Discover Existing Connections and Candidate Sources

Check what exists before creating.

**Existing Glue connections:**

```bash
aws glue get-connections --filter ConnectionType=<TYPE> --region <REGION>
```

If a suitable one exists, confirm and skip to Step 7.

**Candidate sources in account** (JDBC/Redshift only):

- RDS: `aws rds describe-db-instances`
- Aurora: `aws rds describe-db-clusters`
- Redshift: `aws redshift describe-clusters`

Present candidates to user; let them pick. See [discovery.md](references/discovery.md).

### 5. Register Credentials

You MUST encourage AWS Secrets Manager over plaintext passwords. You SHOULD prefer IAM database authentication where supported (Aurora/RDS MySQL and PostgreSQL, Redshift). See [credential-security.md](references/credential-security.md).

- You MUST confirm with user before creating a new Secrets Manager secret
- You MUST NOT write plaintext credentials into chat or logs
- For IAM DB auth, no secret is needed

### 6. Create the Glue Connection

Follow the source-specific reference for connection properties:

```bash
aws glue create-connection --connection-input '<JSON>' --region <REGION>
```

Private sources require `PhysicalConnectionRequirements` (SubnetId, SecurityGroupIdList, AvailabilityZone). See [network-setup.md](references/network-setup.md).

### 7. Test the Connection

You MUST test before handing off. Testing is two-phase: a quick API check, then an engine-level verification.

#### Phase A: Glue TestConnection (network and credential sanity check)

```bash
aws glue test-connection --connection-name <NAME> --region <REGION>
```

This validates that Glue can reach the source and authenticate. It does NOT prove the connection works end-to-end with the query engine the user plans to use.

#### Phase B: Engine-level verification

After TestConnection passes, verify the connection works with the user's intended engine by running a minimal query through it:

- **Glue ETL (default):** Run a smoke-test Glue job that reads one row via the connection. See [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).
- **Athena:** If the user plans to query via Athena with a federated connector, run a `SELECT 1` through the Athena connection to confirm the Lambda-based connector can reach the source.
- **Glue Crawler:** If the user plans to crawl the source, run a test crawl on a single table.

Phase B catches issues that TestConnection misses: driver compatibility at job runtime, catalog configuration, Spark-level serialization, and engine-specific auth flows (e.g., Snowflake SNOWFLAKE type works in ETL but not via JDBC crawlers).

On success in both phases, tell user the connection name is ready for `ingesting-into-data-lake`. On failure in either phase, Step 8.

### 8. Troubleshoot (only if test failed)

Diagnose in order: network, credentials, driver. See [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).

**Constraints:**

- You MUST check VPC routing, security groups, and S3 VPC endpoint before blaming credentials
- You MUST verify Glue role can read the Secrets Manager secret
- You MUST NOT rotate credentials without user confirmation

## Argument Routing

- No args: Walk through Steps 1-7 interactively
- Source type keyword (e.g., `snowflake`, `oracle`): Skip to Step 2 with the type prefilled
- Existing connection name: Skip to Step 7 (test) then Step 8 if failing
- Hostname or RDS endpoint: Skip to Step 4 with the candidate prefilled

## Gotchas

- Glue's `SNOWFLAKE` connection type is distinct from `JDBC` configured for Snowflake. You MUST use `SNOWFLAKE` for Spark ETL jobs; do not use JDBC.
- Connection names are immutable. Choose carefully.
- `PhysicalConnectionRequirements.AvailabilityZone` MUST match the subnet's AZ or the connection fails at job runtime, not creation time.
- IAM database authentication tokens expire in 15 minutes. The Glue job generates a fresh token on each connection; do not cache.
- An S3 VPC gateway endpoint MUST exist in the VPC used by private-source connections. Without it, Glue jobs cannot read their scripts or write results to S3.

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Connect timed out` | VPC routing, SG rule, or NAT gateway missing | See [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) |
| `Access denied for user` / `ORA-01017` | Credentials wrong, Secrets Manager access missing, or IAM DB auth misconfigured | See [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) |
| `No suitable driver found` | Custom driver JAR not set or wrong class name | See [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) |
| `SSL handshake failed` | `JDBC_ENFORCE_SSL` mismatch between Glue and source | See [troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) |
| `UnableToFindVpcEndpoint` | S3 VPC endpoint missing | Create S3 gateway endpoint in the connection's VPC |
